Gongo - a Go player written in Go
Author: Brian Slesinsky
Last update: December 6, 2009

This is a simple computer program that plays Go, but not very well. I
wrote it while learning the Go programming language. It's mostly of interest
as a starting point for people who might want to write Go robots in Go,
and as a example of a reasonably well-commented program written in the
Go language.

The algorithm is based on the Java reference bot by Don Dailey, with some
performance improvements. The Java refbot is described here:
